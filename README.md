# ðŸŒµ RedThumb - Smart Pot ðŸŒµ
The Red Thumb Smart Pot is an autonomous plant sustaining system that is capable of monitoring the plants through remote access. This is to encourage the presence of house plants in your home by creating an easy to use system to attend to the plants, and overall, promoting a healthier and more natural environment for them to not only survive, but thrive.

This Project was completed as part of the SYSC 3010 - Computer Systems Development Project at Carleton University. Enjoy!
